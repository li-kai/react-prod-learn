## What is this

A step-by-step guide of building a production grade React boilerplate with the following requirements:

- Code splitting
- Route based passive preloading
- Hot Reload
- CSS Modules
- Internationalization (i18n)
- Service worker caching
- Feature flagging

## How to follow the guide

Each step is a branch of it's own, building off from the previous. The READMEs in each branches will explain what is going on.

## Why

React in production has become a beast in terms of configurations. Time to dig into the details and learn along.
